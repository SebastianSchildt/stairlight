# stairlight

Nothing to see here, just trying to learn rust.
Doesn't go that well until now... 

App should monitor a light on a hue bridge and switch on an espurna-based device based on the lights state.

So far it can monitor a hue light and switch on/off Espurna. Not state-handling (will hammer espurna), and no sync of colors)
